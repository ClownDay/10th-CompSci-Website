    <h2>Pelenay</h2>
    <p>Pelenay the prodigious pondered, deep in thought.</p>
    <p>To Pelenay the prodigious, other's brain's were rot.</p>
    <p>Pelenay the prodigious would muse and mull.</p>
    <p>To her great intellect, the world was dull.</p>
    <p>All the joys of life and people.</p>
    <p>Pelenay believed them to be feeble.</p>
    <p>Disdain her primary motivator</p>
    <p>She contributed nothing, did no labor.</p>
    <p>And so, as gifted and great she may be</p>
    <p>She was lower than the smallest flea.</p>
