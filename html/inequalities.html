    <h2>An Introduction to Basic Inequalities</h2>
    <p>Disclaimer: This website is being made by a 10th grader with very little knowledge on inequalities and struggles to derive the AM-GM inequality on his own. It will also largely be a regurgitation of knowledge from a book about inequalities he read. Due to a lack of willpower to convert things to LaTeX, most math will be in plain text, making it painful to read.</p>
    <h3>What is an Inequality?</h3>
    <p>Traditionally in algebra, we are dealing with known quantities and variables and solving with them. With inequalities, we have only limited information on the constraints or interval a value lies on. We can still use and manipulate these inequalities, although we must be more careful than with traditional equalities. Multiplication with a negative number, adding and subtracting different inequalities, and squaring terms can lead to false inequalities and bad results.</p>
    <h3>Basic Inequalities</h3>
    <p>I am compelled to talk about the <b>Trivial Inequality</b> first, simply due to its name. The inequality states that x^2 >= 0 for all real x. This can easily be proved in cases, starting with x > 0. If x > 0, x * x > 0, If x < 0, x is negative and a negative number multiplied by a negative number is positive and greater than 0. Lastly, if x = 0, x*x = 0 which follows x^2 >= 0. Note that equality is only met when x = 0.</p>
