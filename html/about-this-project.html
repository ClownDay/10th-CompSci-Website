    <h2>The Author</h2>
    <p>Hey there! Thanks for checking out this website. I'm currently a sophomore in highschool, and aspiring game developer and CS Major. Some of my hobbies include competition math, exercising, talking to my brother, and, of course, coding!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Why this?</h2>
    <p>To be quite honest, I'm not really sure why I decided on this. I suppose I just wanted to play around with the idea of working between multiple different pages with a clean and elegant navigation system. I'm not sure whether I've accomplished that, but this color scheme is pretty nice (inspired by the Jekyll Hacker Theme).</p>
