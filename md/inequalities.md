# An Introduction to Basic Inequalities

Disclaimer: This website is being made by a 10th grader with very little knowledge on inequalities and struggles to derive the AM-GM inequality on his own. It will also largely be a regurgitation of knowledge from a book about inequalities he read. Due to a lack of willpower to convert things to LaTeX, most math will be in plain text, making it painful to read.

## What is an Inequality?

Traditionally in algebra, we are dealing with known quantities and variables and solving with them. With inequalities, we have only limited information on the constraints or interval a value lies on. We can still use and manipulate these inequalities, although we must be more careful than with traditional equalities. Multiplication with a negative number, adding and subtracting different inequalities, and squaring terms can lead to false inequalities and bad results.

## Basic Inequalities

I am compelled to talk about the **Trivial Inequality** first, simply due to its name. The inequality states that x^2 >= 0 for all real x. This can easily be proved in cases, starting with x > 0. If x > 0, x * x > 0, If x < 0, x is negative and a negative number multiplied by a negative number is positive and greater than 0. Lastly, if x = 0, x*x = 0 which follows x^2 >= 0. Note that equality is only met when x = 0.
