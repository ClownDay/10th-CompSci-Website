# An Introduction to Basic Inequalities

Disclaimer: This website is being made by a 10th grader with very little knowledge on inequalities and struggles to derive the AM-GM inequality on his own. It will also largely be a regurgitation of knowledge from a book about inequalities he read.

## What is an Inequality

Traditionally in algebra, we are dealing with known quantities and variables and solving with them. With inequalities, we have only limited information on the constraints or interval a value lies on. We can still use and manipulate these inequalities, although we must be more careful than with traditional equalities. Multiplication with a negative number, adding and subtracting different inequalities, and squaring terms can lead to false inequalities and bad results.
